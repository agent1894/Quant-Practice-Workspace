# ReadMe.md
This repository contains some pratices during my path to Quant.

All the codes are based on Python3 and hosing by GitHub.

Using https://www.gitignore.io/ can easily create the .gitignore file. Or, GitHub has already prepared the config files: https://github.com/github/gitignore/

The ReadMe file is re-written by markdown instead of txt.

2019/09/01 Updated:

Add the c++ codes. A new parent folder is now created and all config files are moved to.
