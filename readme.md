# ReadMe.md

This repository contains some pratices during my path to Quant.

All the codes are based on Python3 and hosing by GitHub.

Using [gitignore](https://www.gitignore.io/) can easily create the .gitignore file. Or, GitHub has already prepared the config files: [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/)

The ReadMe file is re-written by markdown instead of txt.

2019/09/01 Updated:

Add the C++ codes. A new parent folder is now created and all config files are moved to.
